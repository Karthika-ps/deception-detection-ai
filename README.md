# 🤖 Deception Detection Using AI Technology

A multimodal AI project that detects deceptive behavior using facial, speech, and physiological features.

## 📘 Overview
This project explores multimodal machine learning techniques to detect deception from human behavioral signals. It combines facial expression analysis, speech tone, and heart rate data to improve reliability.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas  
- Signal processing and feature extraction

## 🧩 Key Steps
1. Data extraction from video and physiological recordings  
2. Feature extraction (facial, speech, heart rate)  
3. Model training and validation using multimodal input  
4. Performance evaluation and visualization

## 📈 Results
- Integrating physiological features significantly improved accuracy over unimodal models.

## 📂 Files
- `DeceptionDetectionFinal.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps.

## ✨ Future Improvements
- Expand dataset for real-world generalization  
- Integrate deep learning-based feature extraction (CNN + RNN)
